1 INTRODUCTION 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a simple Python utility for logging data from a [Watts Up? Pro]
power meter.  Documentation for the serial port interface for the
meter is available in [this PDF file].

Other software capable of logging data on the Watts Up? meter are
available for [download from watts up?], and they sell a [realtime version for Windows] for $72.95. One example I found of reading from the Watts
Up? Pro in Python was [this script].

The program will by default assume the most common device name for
Linux and OS X platforms, but the serial port device can also be
specified with the command line option `-p'.

The Watts Up? Pro uses an FTDI serial to USB adapter internally.  If
the driver is not already installed on your operating system, download
the latest driver from the [FTDI website].

2 USAGE 
~~~~~~~~

Basic usage from the command line:

To log realtime data at the default sample rate (1 s) to the file
`sample.log', use
wattsup.py -l -o sample.log

A basic realtime plot can be added to the above with
wattsup.py -l -g -o sample.log
(requires numpy and matplotlib).

Full description of options will be given by
wattsup -h

3 FILES 
~~~~~~~~

`wattsup.py': Program to log, display data to console, and
                  generate a simple real time plot
`plot.py': Simple plotting program for files already logged.
`wattui.py': Experimental [TraitsUI] interface to power meter
                 logging (only does simulated logging for now)

In the `samples' subdirectory, there are several raw data logs that
can be used as sample input with the `--simulation-mode' option.  Note
that they may not be interesting to watch in real time.  These files
log the data as it comes from the serial port, with the `--raw' option.
`ac.raw': Sample data from a small window air conditioner
`fan.raw': Sample data from a two-motor, 3-speed fan
`iphone3gs.raw': Charging an iPhone 3gs
`iphone4.raw': Charging an iPhone 4

4 TO DO 
~~~~~~~~

- Fetching data from internal storage is not yet working
- Plotting is currently very rudimentary.  Some things to add include:
  - Better autoranging
  - Options for plotting power, current, or both
  - Cumulative display or plot of energy used
